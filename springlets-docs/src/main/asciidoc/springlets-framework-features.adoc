== Springlets for Spring Framework features

Springlets for Spring Framework provide additional features for the following Spring 
Framework modules:

[[springlets-context]]
=== Spring Context

To use Springlets for the Spring Framework context module just include the following dependency:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.springlets</groupId>
      <artifactId>springlets-context</artifactId>
      <version>{springlets-version}</version>
    </dependency>
----

It provides the following utilities:

[[springlets-context-validation]]
==== Validation of collections

Spring performs validation by default only on single objects. If you have a collection of objects
to be validated, you can use the Springlets _CollectionValidator_.

_CollectionValidator_ will iterate over the elements of a Collection and run the validation process
for each of them individually. An example of use can be found in the
<<springlets-mvc-advice-validator, validator advice section>>

[[springlets-context-i18nenums]]
==== Enums i18n

In an application which supports many locales you have to show labels in the current locale. By
default, when you have objects with properties of type _enum_ their name is used to show them.

As an example, if we have the following enum:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public enum PetType {

    DOG, CAT, BIRD
}
----

Then you have an object with a property _type_ of _PetType_ type which is shown in a page, like
in the next example of a Thymeleaf template fragment:

[source,html,indent=0]
----
<li id="pet-type-field">
  <strong data-th-text="#{label_pet_type}">type</strong>
  <span data-th-text="${{pet.type}}">typeValue</span>
</li>
----

The result will be:

[source,html,indent=0]
----
<li id="pet-type-field">
  <strong>Type:</strong>
  <span>DOG</span>
</li>
----

To provide an easy way to manage the i18n of enums in any use case where an enum is converted to text
through the _ConversionService_, Springlets registers the _EnumToMessageConverter_ class. It will look
for a message with the following format: *enum_CLASS_NAME*, being *CLASS* the enum simple class name,
and name the enum value name. If it is not found it defaults to the enum name.

With the previous example, you just would have to add the following entries to your
_messages*.properties_:

[source,properties,indent=0]
.messages.properties
----
enum_PetType_DOG = Dog
enum_PetType_CAT = Cat
enum_PetType_Bird = Bird
----

[source,properties,indent=0]
.messages-es.properties
----
enum_PetType_DOG = Perro
enum_PetType_CAT = Gato
enum_PetType_Bird = PÃ¡jaro
----

This way, the sample html template with an Spanish locale would generate the following:

[source,html,indent=0]
----
<li id="pet-type-field">
  <strong>Tipo:</strong>
  <span>Perro</span>
</li>
----

[[springlets-context-i18nobjects]]
==== Objects i18n

Similar to the i18n of enums, sometimes you have an object property that you would like to show
as a String. This is usually the case of a JPA entity with a relation to another one.

By default, the object value is converted to String by calling it's _toString()_ method. But this
is not a good idea, as this method is not defined to provide a text to show an object in user
interfaces. Also it doesn't support formatting related to a property or to a locale.

Springlets provides some utilities and an annotation to easily manage the conversion of properties
and objects to String, in a way similar to the Spring *@DateTimeFormat* and *@NumberFormat*
annotations.

The annotation is *@EntityFormat*. Although the typical use case is for entities, it will work
on any Java class. It can be used at:

* class level: sets the default format to convert an object of the class. If the annotation
is used without any parameters, the _toString()_ method is used to generate the _String_.
* property level: sets the format to convert the values of that property. The annotation can be 
included without parameters, in which case the format will be the one defined the property's type 
class level. 

The annotation provides the following parameters:

* *expression*: a SpEL expression that can be created with the object properties.

Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@EntityFormat("#{name} (#{type})")
public class Pet {
    
  private String name;

  @NumberFormat
  private Float weight;

  private PetType type;

  // Constructors, getters, setters, ...
}
----

With this expression, an instance of _Pet_ with name *"Rocky"* and _PetType_ *DOG* will be shown
as *"Rocky (Dog)"*.

* *message*:  message code to use to get an internationalized expression to apply based on the
current {@link Locale}.

This is an example using the _message_ property and the *@EntityFormat* annotation applied to 
a property:

[source,java,indent=0]
.Pet.java
----
public class Pet {
    
  private String name;

  @NumberFormat
  private Float weight;

  private PetType type;

  @EntityFormat(message = "format_pet_owner")
  private Owner owner;

  // Constructors, getters, setters, ...
}
----

[source,properties,indent=0]
.messages.properties
----
format_pet_owner=#{lastName}, #{firstName} 
----

[source,properties,indent=0]
.messages-es.properties
----
format_pet_owner=#{firstName} #{lastName} 
----

With this configuration, if a _Pet.owner_ property is formatted, depending on the current locale,
one of the two formats will be applied.

===== Parsing objects

If you use the _@EntityFormat_ annotation to format a property, it will be used also in the other way around to get the object from a text value, as a _Parser_ will be automatically created to handle the conversion.

This comes handy, for example, when you provide a Rest service with a parameter which is an object with a relation to another one. This way the message only needs to provide an object text identifier as the property value.

Spring Data provides a similar utility to convert and object identifier as String to the real object, by converting the text to the object identifier type and then loading the object through its _Repository_. But if you have a Service layer between your controllers and your repositories, this utility goes over it.

To avoid that problem, the _EntityParser_ looks for a component in the Spring context which implements the _EntityParser_ interface for the object type and its identifier type. This allows, for example, to make your services implement that interface to resolve the object instances.

For example, if you have a _Pet_ JPA Entity, with a related _PetService_ which uses a _PetRepository_ to load the data form a database. The _PetService_ would implement the _EntityResolver_ as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
.Pet.java
----
@Entity
@EntityFormat("#{name} (#{type})")
public class Pet {

    @Id
    private Long id;

    // Other properties, getters/setters, ...
}
----

[source,java,indent=0]
.PetService.java
----
@Service
public class PetService implements EntityResolver<Pet, Long> {

    public Class<Pet> getEntityType() {
        return Pet.class;
    }
    
    public Class<Long> getIdType() {
        return Long.class;
    }

    public Pet findOne(Long id) {
        return getPetRepository().findOne(id);
    }
    
    // Other methods and properties ...
}
----

Then, another entity could have a property of type _Pet_,

[source,java,indent=0]
.Visit.java
----
@Entity
public class Visit {

    @EntityFormat
    private Pet pet;

    // Other properties, getters/setters, ...
}
----

This way, if you have a Rest Controller that allows to create visits for Pets, the method would
allow to receive a JSON message with a property _pet_ having as value the identifier of the _Pet_
to assign to the _Visit_.

[NOTE]
====
Take into account the conversion to and from text provided by the _EntityFormat_ annotation will
not be reversible. The conversion to text will be performed using the provided expression, but
the conversion to object will expect the object identifier. 
Can be made reversible if you provide an expression that uses the object identifier, but that
won't be usually the case.

[[springlets-mvc]]
=== Spring MVC

To use Springlets for Spring MVC just include the following dependency:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.springlets</groupId>
      <artifactId>springlets-web</artifactId>
      <version>{springlets-version}</version>
    </dependency>
----

It provides the following utilities for the Spring MVC web framework:

[[springlets-mvc-jackson-bindingresult]]
==== Sending a BindingResult in a RestController

In a Spring MVC HTML view is a common practice to provide binding and validation
information to the user when data is sent through a form. This is achieved through
the _BindingResult_ class, which is created by Spring MVC with the results
of the binding process.

If you would like to use the same technique in a Spring MVC RestController, or a
controller annotated with _@ResponseBody_, whose response is converted to JSON or
XML through the Jackson library, Springlets provides a Jackson Serializer.

To enable it, just add the _@EnableSpringletsWebJacksonSupport_ annotation to a 
configuration class. If you are using Spring boot, there is an even easier way
to do it just by including a boot starter. More details can be found in the Springlets
for Spring Boot features.

Once enabled, you can use the _@Valid_ annotation with the _@RequestBody_ parameter
and return a _BindingResult_ object in your controller methods that
will be serialized by Jackson and returned in the response. 

An example in a _@RestController_ annotated class to update a _Pet_ entity would be:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
    @PutMapping(name = "update")
    public ResponseEntity<?> update(@Valid @RequestBody Pet pet, BindingResult result) {
        
        if (result.hasErrors()) {
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CONFLICT).body(result);
        }
       
        // Update the pet 
        // ...

        return ResponseEntity.ok().build();
    }
----

[[springlets-mvc-jackson-hibernate5]]
==== Enabling support for hibernate 5 lazy properties in Jackson

If you try to serialize a JPA Entity with Jackson, maybe because it's the result of a JPA
query returned in a _RestController_, if there are any lazy loaded properties still not
loaded, it will fail. Jackson doesn't know how to serialize those attributes by default.

To solve it you have to add the Hibernate 5 Jackson module and register it, which is
automatically performed by the _@EnableSpringletsWebJacksonSupport_ annotation.

[[springlets-mvc-notfound]]
==== Default exception for not found responses

When a request is made for a resource that doesn't exist, usually a 404 response 
(Not Found) is returned.

As this is a typical scenario, springlets provides a _NotFoundException_ annotated
with _@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)_ that you can throw in those cases:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
    @ModelAttribute
    public Owner getOwner(@PathVariable("owner") Long id) {
        Owner owner = ownerService.findOne(id);
        if (owner == null) {
            throw new NotFoundException(String.format("Owner with identifier '%s' not found", id));
        }
        return owner;
    }
----

[[springlets-mvc-advice]]
==== Controller advices

There are some controller advices usually used in web projects that are provided by default by
springlets. All of them are available just by adding the _@EnableSpringletsWebMvcAdvices_ annotation
to your configuration classes.

[[springlets-mvc-advice-stringtrimmer]]
===== StringTrimmerAdvice

Registers a _StringTrimmerEditor_ in the data binder to be able to trim strings that come as 
parameters.

The editor can be configured with the *springlets.mvc.advices.trimeditor.** properties.

[[springlets-mvc-advice-jsonp]]
===== JsonpAdvice

Registers a controller advice to instruct the MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter to serialize
with JSONP formatting.

The advice can be configured with the *springlets.mvc.advices.jsonp.** properties.

[[springlets-mvc-advice-validator]]
===== ValidatorAdvice

Controller advice that adds the <<springlets-context-validation,Springlets CollectionValidator>>
to the WebDataBinder. This way you can have Collections of objects as parameters in your
controllers that can be validated, like in the following example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
    @PostMapping(value = "/batch", name = "createBatch")
    public ResponseEntity<?> createBatch(@Valid @RequestBody Collection<Owner> owners, BindingResult result) {
        
        if (result.hasErrors()) {
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CONFLICT).body(result);
        }
        
        getOwnerService().save(owners);
        
        return ResponseEntity.created(listURI().toUri()).build();
    }
