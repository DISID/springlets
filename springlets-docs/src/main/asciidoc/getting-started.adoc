If you're just getting started with Springlets, or 'Spring' in general, this is the section
for you! Here we answer the basic "`what?`", "`how?`" and "`why?`" questions. You'll
find a gentle introduction to Spring Boot along with installation instructions.
We'll then build our first Spring Boot application, discussing some core principles as
we go.

[[getting-started-introducing-springlets]]
== Introducing Springlets

Springlets provides a series of heterogeneus utilities and Spring Boot starters not currently
available in the Spring projects like Spring Framework, Spring Data or Spring Boot, as well 
as other open source projects used in Java web projects.

Our goal in Springlets is to follow the conventions used in the Spring projects (naming, 
versioning, project structure, â€¦) as close as possible. As a matter of fact, you can 
easily view to which Spring project are related most Springlet modules, as their name has been
created by replacing the spring prefix with springlets.


[[getting-started-system-requirements]]
== System Requirements

The Springlets 1.x versions will be associated to the Spring IO platform Athens releases.
As a result, Springlets 1.x will depend on the Spring Framework 4.3 releases. Also JDK 7 and 8
are supported.

Dependencies are provided through Maven Central to be used in Maven (3.2+), but other tools
like can be also used.

For other requirements, just take a look at the related Spring projects requirements.

[[getting-started-installing-springlets]]
== Installing Springlets
Springlets can be used with "`classic`" Java development tools. 
Regardless, you will need http://www.java.com[Java SDK v1.7] or higher. You
should check your current Java installation before you begin:

[indent=0]
----
	$ java -version
----

[[getting-started-installation-instructions-for-java]]
=== Installation instructions for the Java developer
You can use Springlets in the same way as any standard Java library. Simply include the
appropriate `+springlets-*.jar+` files on your classpath.

Although you _could_ just copy the Springlets jars, we generally recommend that you use a
build tool that supports dependency management (such as Maven or Gradle).



[[getting-started-maven-installation]]
==== Maven installation
Springlets is compatible with Apache Maven 3.2 or above. If you don't already have Maven
installed you can follow the instructions at http://maven.apache.org.

TIP: On many operating systems Maven can be installed via a package manager. If you're an
OSX Homebrew user try `brew install maven`. Ubuntu users can run
`sudo apt-get install maven`.

Springlets dependencies use the `io.springlets` `groupId`. Depending on your project's 
needs, you just have to select which springlets dependency have to include in your project.


[[getting-started-upgrading-from-an-earlier-version]]
=== Upgrading from an earlier version of Springlets
If you are upgrading from an earlier release of Springlets check the "`release notes`"
hosted on the {github-wiki}[project wiki]. You'll find upgrade instructions along with
a list of "`new and noteworthy`" features for each release.
